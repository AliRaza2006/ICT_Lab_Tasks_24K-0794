        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Ali Raza, currently pursuing my Computer Science degree at FAST NUCES University. When I'm not immersed in my studies, I enjoy spending my free time exploring the world of video games, particularly titles like Valorant and Counter-Strike. 
            Gaming has always been a great way for me to unwind while keeping my mind sharp and focused.

            I'm always eager to connect with other tech enthusiasts, share insights, and learn from others in the field. </p>
