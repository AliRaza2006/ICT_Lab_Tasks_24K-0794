        <h2 class="intro"><u>Introduction:</u></h2>
        <p>The Special Theory of Relativity, formulated by Albert Einstein in 1905, revolutionized our
            understanding of space, time, and energy. At its core, the theory addresses how the laws of
            physics are consistent for all observers, regardless of their constant velocity relative to each
            other. It challenged the classical notions of absolute space and time, introducing the concept that
            time and space are interwoven into a single continuum known as spacetime.<br><br>
            One of the key postulates of Special Relativity is that the speed of light in a vacuum is the same
            for all observers, regardless of their motion or the motion of the light source. This leads to
            several profound consequences, such as time dilation—where time slows down for an object in
            motion relative to a stationary observer—and length contraction, where objects in motion appear
            shorter along the direction of motion.<br><br>
            Special Relativity also brought forth the famous equation E = mc<sup>2</sup>
            , which shows the
            equivalence of mass and energy, highlighting that energy can be converted into mass and vice
            versa. This equation has profound implications in fields ranging from nuclear physics to
            cosmology.</p>

        <h3 class="intro"><u>Time Dilation:</u></h3>
        <p>Time dilation is a concept from Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, where time slows down
            for an object moving at high speeds relative to a stationary observer. For instance, a clock on a
            fast-moving spaceship would tick more slowly compared to a clock on Earth. This effect
            becomes more noticeable as the object's speed approaches the speed of light, meaning time
            passes differently depending on the relative motion between observers. The time dilation
            equation for special relativity (due to relative velocity) is given by:</p>
        
            <p class="formula">\( t = \frac{t_o}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \)</p>

        <h3 class="intro"><u>Length contraction:</u></h3>
        <p>Length contraction is another concept from Einstein's theory of special relativity. It refers to the
            phenomenon where the length of an object moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light
            appears shorter in the direction of its motion when measured by a stationary observer. The
            equation for length contraction is given by:</p>
            <p class="formula">\( l = l_o \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \)</p>

        <h3 class="intro"><u>Mass variation:</u></h3>
        <p>Mass variation in the context of special relativity refers to how the mass of an object increases
            with its velocity. This concept is closely related to the idea of relativistic mass, where the mass of
            an object depends on its speed relative to an observer. The relativistic mass m of an object
            moving at a velocity v is given by:</p>
            <p class="formula">\( m = \frac{m_0}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \)</p>
            <table>
